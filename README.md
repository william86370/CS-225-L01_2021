# Introduction to Computer Security 3840 Syllabus

**Textbook**:  _Computer Security: Principles and Practice,_ 4th ed., by William Stallings and Lawrie Brown

**Course Description**: An introduction to the principle of computer security. Topics include computer and systems security, authentication, access control, malicious software, and software security. The course also examines how system designs, network protocols, and software engineering practices can result in vulnerabilities. The course explores how to design and implement systems to mitigate vulnerabilities. In addition, the course explores how to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in existing systems.

**Prerequisite**: CS2430

**Course Objectives**: The objectives of the course are to provide the student with an overview of the fundamental issues of information system security and assurance. Students will be exposed to the spectrum of security activities, methods, methodologies, and procedures through lectures, discussions, home works, labs and case studies, etc.

**Student Learning Outcomes**: Upon completion of this course, students should be able to

1.  Use basic cryptographic techniques in software and system design.
2.  Apply methods for authentication, access control, intrusion detection and prevention.
3.  Identify and mitigate software security vulnerabilities in existing systems.
4.  Learn coding styles that reduce the chance introducing vulnerabilities.
5.  Evaluate the security risks of systems and perform security audits.
6.  Understand the ethical and legal issues in system security.
